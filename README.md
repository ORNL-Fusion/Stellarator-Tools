# Testing
[![Continuous Integration Test](https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/Stellarator-Tools/actions/workflows/ci_test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/Stellarator-Tools/actions/workflows/ci_test.yaml)

# Compiling
To compile the code, first clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/Stellarator-Tools.git
```

A `Stellarator-Tools` directory will be created. In this directory create a `build` directory and navigate to it.

```
cd Stellarator-Tools
mkdir build
cd build
```

It's recommended that you use the `ccmake` to configure the build system. From inside the build directory, run the `ccmake` command

```
ccmake ../
```

Initally, there will be no options.

press the `c` key to configure. Once configured, there will be several options. Different codes in the Stellarator Tools suite of codes can be configured to be built by toggling the `BUILD_<CODE>` from `off` to `on`. The build system will automatically turn on any dependencies. You can also set new options like the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.

After changing settings, keep pressing `c` until the `g` option appears.

After hitting `g` option `ccmake` will exit and a `Makefile` will be generated. The codes can be built using the `make` command.

## Touble Shooting
If `cmake` fails to find the correct libraries, you may need to set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` variable to help locate them.
